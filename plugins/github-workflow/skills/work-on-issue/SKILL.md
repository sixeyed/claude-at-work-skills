# Work on Issue

Pick up a GitHub issue, implement it on a branch, and leave the work committed locally. Create and read only — this skill never merges, never commits to the default branch, never deletes anything.

## Preflight — refuse to start if the tree isn't clean

1. **Find the repo:** derive `owner/repo` from `git remote get-url origin`. No remote? Stop and tell the user to push the repo to GitHub first.
2. **Find your GitHub access:** this plugin bundles the GitHub MCP connector (see `.mcp.json`), so prefer its tools first. If they aren't available, the connector needs a one-time authorization — point the user to **Settings → Connectors → github-workflow → Connect** (GitHub OAuth) and stop until it's done; don't tell them to add a connector manually (it's already installed). Fallback: the `gh` CLI if installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`), noting it's generally unavailable in a Cowork sandbox. See `README.md` for setup.
3. **Check the working tree:** if `git status` shows uncommitted changes, **stop before doing anything else**. Show the user what's modified and let them decide — stash, commit, or discard is their call, especially when the changes touch files the issue needs. Do not stash or discard on their behalf.

## Steps

1. Fetch the issue and all its comments (`gh issue view N --comments`) — the comments often carry the real acceptance criteria. If the user gave words instead of a number, search for the issue and confirm you found the right one.
2. Confirm you understand the scope. If the issue is ambiguous, ask before writing code — a wrong branch is more expensive than a question.
3. Update the default branch (`git pull`), then create a branch named `issue-NN-short-slug`, e.g. `issue-14-auth-rate-limiting`. Always this pattern — the number links the branch to the issue for everyone who reads `git branch`.
4. Implement the change following the repo's `CLAUDE.md` conventions — code style, test framework, commit format all come from there, not from habit.
5. Run the tests. Don't move on until they pass.
6. Commit with messages that reference `#NN` so GitHub links the commits to the issue.

## Where this skill stops

**The last action is the final local commit.** Do not push. Do not open a pull request — not even as a favor, not even if it feels like the obvious next step. Pushing and raising the PR is the `create-pr` skill, and keeping it separate means the user takes that step deliberately. Finish by telling the user the branch name, what's committed, and that `create-pr` is ready when they are.

## Report

End by reporting: issue number and title, branch name, test results, and the commits made.
